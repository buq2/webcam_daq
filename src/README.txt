CDAQ project aims to create simple library for image and analog data
acquisition. Project uses cmake (http://www.cmake.org/) for builds and
it should work both in Windows and Unix systems. Image capturing is
limited to 8bit RGB image (as this is the most common format of web
cameras). DAQ library is designed for "old TUT/ASE 8channel daq" but
adding newer daqs should be reasonable easy.
